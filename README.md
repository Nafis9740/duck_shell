# Duck Shell
This a python based multi threaded reverse shell to interact with multiple clients

Beneficial to control multiple servers

I encourage to use this software ethically

However i am not responsible for using this software to infect or damage any systems

Run the server.py before running client.py

Type "clients" to view clients

Type " select <client numbner>" to interact with the client

Example: 
duck_shell> 
Connection has been established 192.168.1.4
Type show clients or select [x] to list or select clients
clients
----Clients----
0  192.168.1.x  xxxx

duck_shell> select 0
You are now connected to 192.168.1.x
192.168.1.4>
